# cancer_cell_classification

This was the final project for my Machine Learning in Chemical Sciences and Enginering class at Virginia Tech. The goal of this project was to find a publicly available dataset related to any field within the life sciences and engineering space then develop and compare machine learning models to predict imporant information about the dataset. 

One of my areas of interest is Biomedical Informatics so I chose to use the breast_cancer dataset from the sklearn.datasets module and developed three different machine learning models to predict whether a cancer cell was benign or malignant.

I compared three different models using Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Naive Bayes under different sets of features.
